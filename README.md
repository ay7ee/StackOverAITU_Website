# StackOverAITU_Website
This project was created by a team of 3 people. This topic was chosen because of the complicated system of education in the
university AITU (Astana IT University). Since the learning only programming 
here, students need to collaborate with each other. But what does “collaborate” 
here mean for students who study in the IT sphere? It means asking for help 
from other students to solve their individual problems and also help them with 
similar tasks. There are a lot of students who struggle with their tasks, steps or 
even knowledge of programming languages. So, the project called “Stack 
Overflow AITU” solves this kind of problem. There can be found several types 
of solutions for your questions and help to solve them. To be precise, the main 
goal of the project is to maximally help our students with their education 
process and the most important is to reduce the number of retakers (the group of 
students who took a retake from courses)

### CONCLUSION 
From the beginning of the project there was done a lot of work. Starting with 
the choosing and defining the purpose of the project until recreating it visually. 
Stack OverFlow AITU is the perfect way to increase the knowledge of our 
students. It not only allows us to save our time from searching the solution 
across the internet but also can help others with the same problem. Therefore it 
creates a chain of queues.
